My pet project trying to recreate Wolfenstein 3D in Godot, looking as close to the original as possible.

There is still alot missing,  like only Level 1 is created, there is no Enemy AI, only guard enemy, no title screen, no end screen etc. etc.  

So until now it's just an excercise for me to learn Godot.
